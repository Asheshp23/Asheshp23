Passionate iOS developer crafting intuitive digital experiences that simplify lives and spark joy. When not immersed in code, I'm exploring the transformative power of meditation and gratitude - finding peace in our chaotic world and sharing these practices with others. My journey weaves technology with personal growth, believing that mindfulness enhances creativity and innovation. As Rabindranath Tagore wrote, "The butterfly measures its existence not by months, but by moments, and it has plenty of time." - a philosophy that guides both my development work and spiritual explorations.
